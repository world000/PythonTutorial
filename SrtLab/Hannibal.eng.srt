1
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:39,116
Sometimes Dr. Lecter and I
would talk...

2
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:41,095
when things got quiet enough...

3
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:43,176
about the science courses
I was takin'.

4
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:46,991
Some kind of mail-order courses
in psychology, Nurse Barney?

5
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:48,432
No, sir.

6
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:51,279
I don't consider psychology
a science...

7
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:53,801
and neither did Dr. Lecter.

8
00:00:56,402 --> 00:00:57,896
Now, Barney...

9
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,425
while you were working
at the asylum...

10
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:06,313
you observed Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter interacting.

11
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:08,011
Interacting?

12
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:10,733
Talking to one another.

13
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:13,519
Yes.
Yes, it seemed to me that they...

14
00:01:13,586 --> 00:01:16,968
I can see you're eager to justify
your consulting fee...

15
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,107
but why don't we start
with what you saw...

16
00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:22,152
not what you thought about
what you saw?

17
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:26,503
Cordell, don't be like that.
Barney can give us his opinion.

18
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:30,636
Barney, give us your opinion
of what you saw.

19
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:33,007
What was it between them?

20
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:38,315
Most of the time, Dr. Lecter
didn't respond at all to visitors.

21
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:41,102
He'd just, for instance,
open his eyes long enough...

22
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,203
to insult some academic
who was there to look over him.

23
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:48,235
With Starling,
he answered her questions.

24
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:51,950
She interested him.
She intrigued him.

25
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:55,366
He thought she was charming
and amusing.

26
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:59,111
So Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter...

27
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,000
became friendly.

28
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:05,840
Inside a kind of formal structure,
yes.

29
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:09,004
And he was fond of her.

30
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,389
Yes.

31
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,701
Thank you, Barney.

32
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,712
Thank you very much
for your candor.

33
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:19,949
And keep all those wonderful items...

34
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:22,636
from your personal Lecter
treasure trove coming.

35
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:24,429
I've enjoyed them immensely.

36
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:26,155
Mr. Verger.

37
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:28,647
Oh, I almost forgot.

38
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:31,307
I might be able to get a cookie down.
What do you say, Cordell?

39
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:33,744
I think it would kill you.

40
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:44,816
How much?
Two hundred and fifty.

41
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,605
Thousand.

42
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:52,331
Cut a check for $250,000.

43
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:44,047
How can she sleep
at a time like this?

44
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:48,206
She's on a jump-out squad all night.
She's saving her strength.

45
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:20,167
We got some guy named Bolton
from the DC Police.

46
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:24,305
All right, everyone.
Pay attention. Here's the layout.

47
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,857
Excuse me.
I'm Officer Bolton, DC Police.

48
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,296
I can see that from your badge.
How do you do?

49
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,823
I'm in charge here.

50
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,036
Officer Bolton,
I'm Special Agent Starling.

51
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:35,177
Just so we don't get off
on the wrong foot...

52
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:37,354
let me explain
why we're all here.

53
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:41,386
I'm here because I know Evelda Drumgo.
I arrested her twice on RICO warrants.

54
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:43,977
DEA and ATF, in addition
to backing me up...

55
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:45,991
are here for the drugs
and the weapons.

56
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:48,880
You're here because our mayor
wants to appear tough on drugs...

57
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:51,117
especially after his own
cocaine conviction...

58
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:53,804
and hopes he can accomplish that
by having you join us here today.

59
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:56,810
You got a smart mouth, lady.

60
00:05:56,881 --> 00:06:00,198
If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it
if you'd let me continue.

61
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:03,432
All right, take a look.

62
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:06,353
Fish market.
Back's on the water.

63
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,621
Across the street, ground floor,
is the meth lab.

64
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:11,023
Evelda Drumgo's HIV positive.

65
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:14,351
She will spit and bite if cornered,
so you should watch it.

66
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,134
If you happen to be the one
who puts her in a patrol car...

67
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:20,071
in front of the news cameras, Bolton,
you don't wanna push her head down.

68
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:22,381
She'll likely have a needle
in her hair.

69
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,133
We want to take her inside the building,
not out in the street.

70
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:27,143
We can get closest with the van.

71
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:30,184
If it looks good, on my signal
we hit the front, DEA hits the back...

72
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,166
DCPD backin'them up.

73
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:34,380
She'll have her watchers out
at least three blocks around.

74
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:38,598
They've tipped her before in time, so
let's not make spectacles of ourselves.

75
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:52,616
Pretty busy today.
I agree.

76
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:00,845
Can I please get
a cup of coffee?

77
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:19,116
Did you see that?
That's a roger.

78
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:28,848
What's up, man?

79
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,791
Goddamn it. It's her.

80
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:42,029
With three guys.
They're all packin'.

81
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:44,911
She's carryin' something.
She's got a baby.

82
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:48,272
Hey, Brigham, it's too crowded.

83
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,410
There are too many people.
I say we call it off.

84
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:51,659
What do you say?

85
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,704
I agree.

86
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:56,013
All units, stand down.

87
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:58,220
Whiskey team copies.
Burke copy.

88
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:00,111
This is Bolton.
Stay on target.

89
00:08:00,177 --> 00:08:02,796
I said all units stand down, Bolton,
right now.

90
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:04,905
It's too late. We're movin'in.
Bolton, he said it's off.

91
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:06,668
Stand down now.

92
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,647
She's carrying a baby.
I repeat, she's carrying a baby.

93
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,110
All units stand down.

94
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:13,127
Keep that gun down, Bolton.
Damn, dude got a piece.

95
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,892
Light his ass up.
It's a go!

96
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,390
FBI! Down on the ground!

97
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:58,635
Hold it!

98
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,614
Hold your fire!

99
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:03,821
Don't!

100
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:09,094
Evelda, get out of the car!

101
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,459
Starling, is that you?

102
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:16,521
Step away from the car!

103
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:20,072
Show me your hands, Evelda.

104
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:24,712
Please.
Show me your hands.

105
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:26,312
How've you been?

106
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:28,010
Don't do this.

107
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,128
Do what?

108
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:02,253
It's all right. It's okay.

109
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:05,190
I know, I know. Baby, I know.

110
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:07,632
It's okay.

111
00:10:07,697 --> 00:10:09,836
It's okay.

112
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:12,839
It's okay.

113
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:33,101
Friends, family and coworkers
gathered here this morning...

114
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:37,130
at Arlington National Cemetery
to bury BATF AgentJohn Brigham...

115
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:40,430
shot and killed in the line of duty
Friday. He was 40 years old.

116
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:43,661
This ill-fated drug raid that claimed
his life and five others...

117
00:10:43,729 --> 00:10:46,217
is the latest in a seemingly
endless series of incidents...

118
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:48,012
beginning with Waco, Texas...

119
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:51,310
in which theJustice Department
and the FBI have been questioned...

120
00:10:51,377 --> 00:10:54,159
about their use of firepower
rather than judgment.

121
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:56,778
This time it was FBI
Special Agent Clarice Starling...

122
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:58,540
heading up
the calamitous strike force.

123
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:02,056
Agent Starling attained some measure
of celebrity ten years ago...

124
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,358
when she was given information
by Dr. Hannibal "The Cannibal"Lecter...

125
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:07,497
which led to the rescue
of Catherine Martin...

126
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:09,871
daughter of the former US senator
from Tennessee.

127
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:13,581
When she returns to work this week,
she won't be so celebrated.

128
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:16,497
Attorney Telford Higgins, representing
one of the families of those slain...

129
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:19,212
says he will file
a wrongful-death suit.

130
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:22,285
Cordell!

131
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,399
Yes, sir.
Get me theJustice Department.

132
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:45,612
Agent Starling?

133
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:49,293
This is John Eldridge from DEA.
Assistant Director Noonan, you know.

134
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:52,395
Larkin Wayne from our Office
of Professional Responsibility.

135
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:54,374
Bob Sneed, ATF.

136
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:57,515
Benny Holcombe, assistant to the mayor.
And Paul Krendler.

137
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:00,006
You know Paul.
Paul's come over from Justice...

138
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:02,503
unofficially,
as a favor to us.

139
00:12:02,577 --> 00:12:04,998
In other words, he's here,
and he's not here.

140
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:10,792
So I take it you've seen the coverage
in the papers and on television?

141
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:13,352
I have nothing to do with the news,
Mr. Krendler.

142
00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:16,108
The woman had a baby in her arms.

143
00:12:16,177 --> 00:12:19,046
There are pictures. You could
see the problem, I would think.

144
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:22,318
Not in her arms.
In a carrier across her chest.

145
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:24,457
In her arms she had a MAC-10.

146
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:27,496
Look, we're here to help you,
Starling.

147
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:30,439
It's gonna be a hell of a lot harder
to do with a combative attitude.

148
00:12:35,377 --> 00:12:37,798
Can I speak freely, Mr. Pearsall?

149
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:42,376
Your agency called this office to get me
assigned to help you on this raid.

150
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,336
I tried to do that.

151
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,302
I clearly expressed my judgment
and was ignored.

152
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:50,311
And now a good agent and a friend
is dead.

153
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:55,817
You shot and killed five people
out there, Agent Starling.

154
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:57,994
Is that how you define
good judgment?

155
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:00,936
This raid was an ugly mess.

156
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:04,009
I ended up in a position
where I had a choice of dying...

157
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:06,023
or shooting a woman
carrying a child.

158
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:08,268
I chose.

159
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:09,930
I shot her.

160
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:13,190
I killed a mother
holding her child.

161
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:17,605
And I regret it.
I resent myself for it.

162
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:20,103
Gentlemen, I'm going
to call a halt to this meeting...

163
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:22,478
and get back to you individually
by phone.

164
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,592
That was a waste of time.

165
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:32,558
You have a secret admirer, Starling.

166
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,040
He isn't much to look at,
but he does have friends in high places.

167
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:39,821
Remember Mason Verger?

168
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,376
Lecter's fourth victim.

169
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:43,911
The rich one.

170
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:46,286
The only one that survived.

171
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:49,929
He says he has some new information
on Lecter he'll only share with you.

172
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:53,514
What do you mean, only share it with me?
You want it, seize it.

173
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:56,618
I'd rather not.
I wasn't speaking to you.

174
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:59,078
When I speak to you, you'll know it
because I'll look at you.

175
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,214
Why would we rather not?

176
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,769
The last time he called was when we took
Lecter off the Ten Most Wanted List.

177
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:09,231
He was upset about that.
We said, "Hey, that's life."

178
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:12,493
He said, "This is a Senate
Oversight Committee...

179
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,088
to make your life miserable. "

180
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:17,063
His family's political contributions
may not be enough...

181
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:18,795
to buy a senator...

182
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:20,774
but they are enough
to rent them from time to time.

183
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:25,032
There's no reason to go through that
if he really does have something new.

184
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:30,854
It's a good deal for you, Starling.
You can't pretend it isn't.

185
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,088
Get to go back
on a celebrated case.

186
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:37,422
I'll take care of the media
for your Drumgo killing.

187
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:38,830
Everyone's gonna be happy.

188
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:41,864
I'm not happy.

189
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:44,620
Well, maybe you're incapable
of being happy.

190
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:47,656
Mr. Krendler...

191
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:51,115
out on the street, you know you might
take a bullet in the line of duty.

192
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:53,519
You accept it or you get out.

193
00:14:53,585 --> 00:14:55,341
You live with it.

194
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:58,027
What you don't expect or accept...

195
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:00,649
is taking one in the back
in your boss's office...

196
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,825
for doing your job
exactly as they've taught you.

197
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:04,489
That makes you unhappy.

198
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,822
Of course you're right, Starling...

199
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,831
but it doesn't change anything.

200
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:12,971
It changes everything.
It changes me.

201
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,618
Hi, I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr. Verger's private physician.

202
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:06,215
How do you do?

203
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:09,638
If you'd be so kind
as to park down at the end.

204
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:17,421
One's eyes adjust to the darkness.

205
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:35,340
Mr. Verger,
Agent Starling is here.

206
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:38,092
Good morning, Mr. Verger.

207
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:40,430
Was that a Mustang
I heard out there?

208
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:41,577
Yes, it was.

209
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:43,437
Five-liter?

210
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,097
Yes.

211
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:47,503
Fast.

212
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:50,024
Cordell, I think
you can leave us now.

213
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:54,320
I thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.

214
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:58,411
You could be useful
seeing about my lunch.

215
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,191
I'll attach this microphone to your
clothing or pillow, if that's okay.

216
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:08,297
By all means.

217
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,110
Here, this should make it easier.

218
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:24,966
You know, I thank God...

219
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,829
for what happened.

220
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:28,969
It was my salvation.

221
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,421
Have you accepted Jesus,
Agent Starling?

222
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,944
Do you have faith?
I was raised Lutheran.

223
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:38,504
That's not what I asked.

224
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:41,838
This is Special Agent
Clarice Starling, 5143690...

225
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:44,621
deposing Mason R. Verger on March 20,
sworn and attested.

226
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,536
I want to tell you about summer camp.
It was a wonderful childhood experience.

227
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,470
We can get to that later.
We can get to it now.

228
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:53,350
You see, it all comes to bear.

229
00:17:53,424 --> 00:17:57,767
It was a Christian camp
my father founded...

230
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:02,183
for poor, unfortunate, cast-off
little boys and girls...

231
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:04,907
who would do anything
for a candy bar.

232
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:07,432
Mr. Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offenses.

233
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:10,821
It's all right.
I have immunity from the US Attorney.

234
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,968
And I have immunity...

235
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,910
from the risen Jesus.

236
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:18,406
And nobody beats the Riz.

237
00:18:19,088 --> 00:18:22,219
Had you ever seen Dr. Lecter before the
court assigned you to him for therapy?

238
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:23,630
What do you mean?

239
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:25,420
Socially?

240
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:30,027
It is what I mean, yes,
if you don't mind talking about it.

241
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:32,005
No, not at all.
I'm not ashamed.

242
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,211
I didn't say you should be.
No, we met conventionally...

243
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,255
as doctor and patient.

244
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:39,051
How did he end up at your house?

245
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:41,935
I invited him, of course...

246
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:45,610
to my pied-a-terre.

247
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,706
I came to the door
in my nicest come-hither outfit.

248
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:51,686
I was concerned...

249
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:54,957
that he'd be afraid of me.

250
00:18:55,024 --> 00:18:58,286
But he didn't seem to be
afraid of me.

251
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:01,416
That's almost funny now.

252
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:04,712
I showed him my toys...

253
00:19:04,784 --> 00:19:07,599
my noose setup,
among other things.

254
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:11,756
It's where you sort of hang yourself,
but not really.

255
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,832
It feels good while you...

256
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:16,647
well, you know.

257
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:17,997
Anyway...

258
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:22,407
he said, "Mason..."
Mason, would you like a popper?

259
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:26,694
And I said, "Would I? Oh, wow!"

260
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,387
Once that kicked in,
I was flying.

261
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:33,199
He said,
"Mason, show me how you smile...

262
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:36,712
to gain the confidence
of a child. "

263
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:39,632
When I smiled...

264
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:42,511
he said,
"Oh, I see how you do it."

265
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:47,116
The good doctor approached me
with a piece of broken mirror.

266
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,199
"Try this."

267
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:51,084
Try peeling off your face...

268
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:54,474
And feeding it to the dogs.

269
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,059
No, I can still see it.

270
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:07,241
Try again.

271
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:10,824
No, I'm afraid not.

272
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:13,481
That's entertainment

273
00:20:15,568 --> 00:20:18,917
Well, it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

274
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,885
You indicated to me that you'd received
some kind of new information.

275
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:43,757
Where did this come from?

276
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,792
Buenos Aires.
I received it two weeks ago.

277
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,048
Where's the package it came in?

278
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,502
Good question. There was nothing
written on it of interest.

279
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:56,365
Did we throw it out?

280
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,366
Yes, I'm afraid we did.

281
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,091
Oh, dear.
You think it'll help?

282
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,102
I hope so.

283
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:06,086
I hope it'll help you catch him...

284
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:10,830
to help cleanse the stigma
of your recent dishonor.

285
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,489
Thank you. That's all I need.

286
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,430
Did you find some rapport
with Dr. Lecter...

287
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:17,926
in your talks at the asylum?

288
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:21,933
I know I did
while I was peeling.

289
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,815
We exchanged information
in a civil way.

290
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,302
But always through the glass.

291
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:28,871
Yes.

292
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:41,934
Isn't it funny?
What's that?

293
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:44,517
You can look at my face...

294
00:21:45,808 --> 00:21:49,005
but you shied when I said
the name of God.

295
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:17,420
Finding what you want?
Are you sure this is all of it?

296
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:19,430
That's all there is now.

297
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,799
There was more, but it's been picked
over little by little over the years.

298
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,688
You know, this stuff's worth
a lot of money in certain circles.

299
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:31,500
It's kind of like the cocaine
that disappears around here...

300
00:22:31,568 --> 00:22:32,877
little by little.

301
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,756
Hey, Barney.

302
00:23:55,824 --> 00:23:58,093
Remember me?

303
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:00,397
Would you agree for the record,
Agent Starling...

304
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:02,220
that I've not been read my rights?

305
00:24:06,256 --> 00:24:10,860
I have not Mirandized Barney.
He is unaware of his rights.

306
00:24:12,496 --> 00:24:14,798
So when you turned Dr. Lecter over
to the Tennessee police...

307
00:24:14,864 --> 00:24:18,792
They weren't civil to him.
They're all dead now.

308
00:24:18,864 --> 00:24:21,101
They only survived his company
three days.

309
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,917
You survived him
six years at the asylum.

310
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:27,017
How'd you do that?
It wasn't just being civil.

311
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:29,739
Yes, it was.

312
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:32,939
Did you ever think, after he escaped,
he might come after you?

313
00:24:33,008 --> 00:24:34,023
No.

314
00:24:34,096 --> 00:24:36,300
He once told me that,
whenever feasible...

315
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:38,375
he preferred to eat the rude.

316
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:42,409
"Free-range rude," he called 'em.
What about you?

317
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,709
You ever think he might come after you?
You ever think about him at all?

318
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:49,038
At least 30 seconds of every day.
I can't help it.

319
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:51,853
He's always with me,
like a bad habit.

320
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:56,910
Do you know what happened to his stuff...
his books, papers, drawings?

321
00:24:56,976 --> 00:24:59,594
Everything got thrown away
when the place closed.

322
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,769
Cutbacks.

323
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,938
I just found out that Dr. Lecter's
signed copy of TheJoy of Cooking...

324
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:08,391
sold to a private collector
for $16,000.

325
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:11,593
It was probably a fake.

326
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:15,494
The seller's affidavit of ownership
was signed "Karen Phlox."

327
00:25:15,568 --> 00:25:18,700
Do you know Karen Phlox?
You should.

328
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:22,543
She filled out your employment
application, but signed it "Barney."

329
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,612
Same thing on your tax returns.

330
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,175
You want the book?
Maybe I can get it back.

331
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,496
I want the x-ray of Lecter's arm
you broke in the attack on that nurse...

332
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,600
and everything else you've got.

333
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,994
We used to talk about
a lot of things at night...

334
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:48,814
after the screamin'
finally died down.

335
00:25:52,336 --> 00:25:56,613
We talked about you sometimes.
You wanna know what he said?

336
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,860
Go get the x-ray.

337
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,630
I'm not a bad guy.

338
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:08,230
I didn't say you were.

339
00:26:08,304 --> 00:26:10,693
Dr. Chilton was a bad guy.

340
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:14,794
After your first visit, he started
taping your conversations with Lecter.

341
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:19,591
These are valuable.

342
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,791
Go on now.

343
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:29,165
You've grieved long enough.

344
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,272
And what'd he say?

345
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,254
What'd he say about me
late at night?

346
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:41,293
He was talking about
inherited, hardwired behavior.

347
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,230
He was using genetics
in the roller pigeons as an example.

348
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:48,810
They fly up in the air, roll backwards
in a display, fallin' to the ground.

349
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,175
There are shallow rollers,
and there are deep rollers.

350
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,182
You can't breed two deep rollers...

351
00:26:54,256 --> 00:26:57,354
or their young, their offspring,
will roll all the way down...

352
00:26:57,424 --> 00:26:59,628
hit and die.

353
00:26:59,696 --> 00:27:02,631
Agent Starling is a deep roller,
Barney.

354
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,152
Let us hope one of her parents
was not.

355
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:09,769
Surely the odd confluence of events
hasn't escaped you, Clarice.

356
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:13,838
Jack Crawford dangles you
in front of me...

357
00:27:13,903 --> 00:27:16,489
then I give you a bit of help.

358
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,796
Do you think it's because
I like to look at you...

359
00:27:18,864 --> 00:27:22,638
and imagine how good
you would taste...

360
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:24,940
Clarice?

361
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:27,496
I don't know. Is it?

362
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:32,005
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

363
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,686
I know they will never, ever
let me out while I'm alive.

364
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:39,016
What I want is a view.

365
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:42,830
I want a window where I
can see a tree or even water.

366
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:45,711
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

367
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:02,020
The Capponi correspondence
goes back to the 13th century.

368
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:04,780
Dr. Fell might hold in his hand...

369
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:06,822
his non-Italian hand...

370
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:09,230
a note from Dante Alighieri himself.

371
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:12,045
But would he recognize it?
I think not.

372
00:28:13,168 --> 00:28:16,430
Gentlemen, you have examined him
in medieval Italian...

373
00:28:16,496 --> 00:28:19,017
and I will not deny
that his language is admirable...

374
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,226
for a straniero.

375
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:24,427
But is he acquainted
with the personalities...

376
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,154
of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?

377
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,966
I think not.

378
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,625
What if he came upon a note
in the Capponi library...

379
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:34,184
say from Guido di Cavalcanti?

380
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:37,900
Would he recognize that?
I think not.

381
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:40,302
They're still arguing?

382
00:28:43,024 --> 00:28:45,577
Sogliato wants the job
for his nephew.

383
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:50,023
But the scholars seem satisfied
with the temporary guy they appointed.

384
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:52,584
If he's such an expert on Dante...

385
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:55,339
let him lecture on Dante
to the Studiolo.

386
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:58,158
Let him face them if he can.
I look forward to it.

387
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,696
Very well. On the 14th.

388
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:21,608
Dr. Fell?

389
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,331
Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi
of the questura.

390
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,812
Commendatore,
how can I be of service?

391
00:29:27,888 --> 00:29:30,638
Sorry. I'm investigating
the disappearance...

392
00:29:30,704 --> 00:29:34,795
of your predecessor,
Signor di Bonaventura.

393
00:29:34,864 --> 00:29:37,581
I was wondering if...
"Predecessor" implies I have the job.

394
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:41,226
Unfortunately, I don't.
Not yet, though I am hopeful.

395
00:29:41,295 --> 00:29:44,940
They are letting me look after
the library for a stipend.

396
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,713
The officers who first checked...

397
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:52,712
didn't find any sort of farewell
or suicide note.

398
00:29:52,784 --> 00:29:54,245
I was wondering if you...

399
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,833
If I come across anything in the Capponi
library stuffed in a drawer or book...

400
00:29:57,904 --> 00:29:59,759
I'll call you at once.

401
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:03,564
Thank you.

402
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:06,317
You've been reassigned.

403
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:10,408
Pardon?

404
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,775
You were on the II Mostro case,
I'm sure I read.

405
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,109
Yes, that's right.
Now you're on this.

406
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:19,023
This is much less grand a case,
I would think.

407
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:22,633
Well, if I thought of my work
in those terms...

408
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:24,231
yes, I guess I'd agree.

409
00:30:24,976 --> 00:30:27,310
A missing person.
Sorry?

410
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:31,172
Were you unfairly dismissed from
the grander case, or did you deserve it?

411
00:30:37,008 --> 00:30:39,626
Regarding this one, Dr. Fell...

412
00:30:39,695 --> 00:30:42,543
are the signore's personal effects
still at the Palazzo?

413
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,495
Packed neatly in four cases
with an inventory.

414
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:50,088
Alas, no note.

415
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,815
I'll send someone over to pick them up.
Thank you for your help.

416
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:08,874
Hey, thanks.

417
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:12,422
How's it going? Any leads?

418
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,495
Yeah, they're all leads.
They just don't lead to him.

419
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:21,925
I don't know how you live
with this stuff.

420
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:24,388
Oh, God.

421
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:26,984
This is from the Guinness Book
of World Records congratulating me...

422
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:30,536
on being the female FBI agent
who has shot and killed the most people.

423
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:55,045
Would you excuse me, please?

424
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:59,114
Sure.

425
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:24,846
Dear Clarice...

426
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:30,182
I've followed with enthusiasm the course
of your disgrace and public shaming.

427
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:33,419
My own never bothered me
except for the inconvenience...

428
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:35,276
of being incarcerated.

429
00:32:35,344 --> 00:32:37,580
But you may lack perspective.

430
00:32:38,864 --> 00:32:40,904
In our discussions
down in the dungeon...

431
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:44,652
it was apparent to me that your father,
the dead night watchman...

432
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,175
figures largely
in your value system.

433
00:32:48,655 --> 00:32:52,779
I think your success in putting an end
toJame Gumb's career as a couturier...

434
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:57,288
pleased you most because you could
imagine your father being pleased.

435
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,037
But now, alas,
you're in bad odor with the FBI.

436
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,689
Do you imagine your daddy
being shamed by your disgrace?

437
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:06,629
Do you see him
in his plain pine box...

438
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:08,613
crushed by your failure...

439
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:11,917
the sorry, petty end
of a promising career?

440
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:15,366
What is worst
about this humiliation, Clarice?

441
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:19,051
Is it how your failure will reflect
on your mommy and daddy?

442
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:23,115
Is your worst fear that people
will now and forever believe...

443
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:26,086
they were indeed just good old
trailer-camp...

444
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,298
tornado-bait white trash...

445
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:30,604
and that perhaps you are too?

446
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:36,648
By the way, I couldn't help noticing
on the FBI's rather dull web site...

447
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,422
that I've been hoisted from the Bureau's
archives of the common criminal...

448
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:44,488
and elevated to the more prestigious
Ten Most Wanted List.

449
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:49,929
Is this coincidence,
or are you back on the case?

450
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:53,348
If so, goody goody, because
I need to come out of retirement...

451
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:55,725
and return to public life.

452
00:33:58,896 --> 00:34:01,383
I imagine you sitting
in a dark basement room...

453
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:04,390
bent over papers
and computer screens.

454
00:34:04,464 --> 00:34:06,406
Is that accurate?

455
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,636
Please tell me truly,
Special Agent Starling.

456
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:15,340
Regards, your old pal,
Hannibal Lecter, MD.

457
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:21,067
PS: : Clearly this new assignment
is not your choice.

458
00:34:21,136 --> 00:34:23,045
Rather, I suppose,
it is part of the bargain.

459
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,837
But you accepted it, Clarice.

460
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:28,423
Yourjob is to craft my doom...

461
00:34:28,495 --> 00:34:31,179
so I'm not sure how well
I should wish you...

462
00:34:31,248 --> 00:34:33,615
but I'm sure
we'll have a lot of fun.

463
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,338
Ta-ta.

464
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,414
"H."

465
00:34:43,343 --> 00:34:44,553
On the letter...

466
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,340
there's one partial fingerprint here.

467
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:50,375
Not enough to hold up in court.
I know it's him.

468
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:52,619
Where he was when he wrote it
is what I need.

469
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:54,956
Well, the paper isn't gonna help.

470
00:34:55,023 --> 00:34:57,838
Yes, it's linen fibre,
yes, it's on the expensive side...

471
00:34:57,903 --> 00:35:02,093
but it's not so rare that you won't find
it in a thousand stationery stores...

472
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,134
throughout the world.

473
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:07,785
It's the same with the ink,
and the same with the wax.

474
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,092
And your Las Vegas postmark?

475
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,837
You can check it out, but I'll bet you
it came from a remailing service.

476
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,139
Las Vegas would be
the last place he'd be.

477
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:19,110
It'd be an assault
on his sense of taste.

478
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:29,230
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

479
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:30,921
I hardly see how you couldn't.

480
00:35:31,824 --> 00:35:34,922
And don't your eyes move
over the things you want?

481
00:35:36,207 --> 00:35:38,095
All right, then. Tell me how.

482
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,436
No.

483
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,576
It's your turn to tell me, Clarice.

484
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:45,837
You don't have any more vacations
to sell on Anthrax Island.

485
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:47,943
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

486
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:50,732
I tell you things,
you tell me things.

487
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:54,061
Not about this case.
About yourself.

488
00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:55,687
Quid pro quo.

489
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:58,542
Yes or no, Clarice?

490
00:36:09,455 --> 00:36:11,278
Hand cream.

491
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,405
Raw ambergris base.

492
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:19,020
Tennessee lavender.

493
00:36:20,015 --> 00:36:22,317
Trace of something else.

494
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:25,032
Fleece.

495
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,822
Lovely.

496
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:31,629
What's ambergris?
Ambergris is a whale product.

497
00:36:31,696 --> 00:36:34,412
Alas, much as we'd like to,
we can't import it.

498
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,197
Endangered Species Act.

499
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:39,500
Where isn't it illegal?
Japan, of course.

500
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:41,607
Couple of places in Europe.

501
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,614
You'd almost certainly find it
somewhere in Paris...

502
00:36:44,688 --> 00:36:47,022
Rome, Amsterdam.

503
00:36:47,087 --> 00:36:48,297
Maybe London.

504
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:52,623
This bouquet was hand-engineered
to someone's specifications.

505
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:56,299
Is there a way of knowing which shops?
Of course. We'll give you a list.

506
00:36:56,368 --> 00:36:59,237
It'll be short.

507
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:12,267
I need opera tickets.

508
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:14,702
I don't think I got any on me.

509
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:17,222
It's sold out,
whatever it's called.

510
00:37:17,295 --> 00:37:21,005
It's the pretty, young wife with the
ever-open beak who needs opera tickets.

511
00:37:30,255 --> 00:37:31,630
Benetti.
What?

512
00:37:31,695 --> 00:37:32,905
Rewind it.

513
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:35,823
I can't rewind it.
I'm making a copy. I'm recording.

514
00:37:46,927 --> 00:37:48,237
What is this?

515
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:50,987
Security camera from a perfume shop
in Via Della Scala.

516
00:37:51,055 --> 00:37:52,965
FBI, through Interpol,
requested a copy.

517
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,374
Why?
They didn't say.

518
00:37:57,263 --> 00:38:00,263
They didn't say?
No. It was actually kind of weird.

519
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:03,084
They were making a point
not to say.

520
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:46,022
Are we going to the opera?
Yes.

521
00:39:46,095 --> 00:39:48,615
Sorry. Yes, we are going.

522
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,542
You got tickets?

523
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:53,923
No, but I will. In fact,
I was just about to look here.

524
00:39:55,247 --> 00:39:59,175
Please, not the back row.
I would like to see it this time.

525
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,471
Nowhere near the back row...

526
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:04,812
no matter what the cost.

527
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:10,886
Tell me, Clarice,
would you want to harm...

528
00:42:10,952 --> 00:42:12,992
those who forced you
to consider it, though?

529
00:42:13,065 --> 00:42:15,104
It's perfectly okay to admit it.

530
00:42:15,176 --> 00:42:17,991
It's perfectly au naturel...

531
00:42:18,056 --> 00:42:19,780
to want to taste the enemy.

532
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,323
It just feels so good.
Tell me, Clarice.

533
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:38,694
What is your worst memory
of childhood?

534
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,248
Jesus, Starling!
Can I help you, Mr. Krendler?

535
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,229
What are you doing
sitting there in the dark?

536
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:44,962
Thinking about cannibalism.

537
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:48,774
People in Justice are thinking too.
You know that?

538
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:50,783
They're thinking, "What exactly
is she doing about Lecter?"

539
00:42:50,857 --> 00:42:53,158
Aren't you curious
why he dines on his victims?

540
00:42:53,224 --> 00:42:55,363
What's the point of that?

541
00:42:55,432 --> 00:42:57,342
Are you writing a book
or are you catching a crook?

542
00:42:57,416 --> 00:43:00,515
To show his contempt
for those who exasperate him.

543
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:04,614
Or sometimes to perform
a public service.

544
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,168
In the case of the flutist,
Benjamin Raspail...

545
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,331
he did it to improve the sound of
the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra...

546
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,302
serving the not-so-talented flute
player's sweetbreads to the board...

547
00:43:14,376 --> 00:43:17,059
with a nice Montrachet
at $700 a bottle.

548
00:43:18,152 --> 00:43:19,908
Wow.

549
00:43:19,976 --> 00:43:22,758
That meal began with green oysters
from the Gironde...

550
00:43:22,824 --> 00:43:25,988
followed by the sweetbreads,
a sorbet...

551
00:43:26,056 --> 00:43:28,707
and then you can read here
in Gourmet Cuisine: :

552
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:32,388
"A notable dark and glossy ragout,
the constituents never determined."

553
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,233
I always figured him
for a queer.

554
00:43:35,304 --> 00:43:37,126
Why would you say that, Paul?

555
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:39,975
All this artsy-fartsy stuff.

556
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,837
Chamber music, tea-party food.
Not that I mean anything personal...

557
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:47,011
if you've got a lot of sympathy
for those people.

558
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,491
What I came to impress
upon you, Starling...

559
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,469
is I better see cooperation.

560
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:55,878
There are no little fiefdoms here.

561
00:43:55,945 --> 00:43:58,595
I want to be copied
on every 302, you understand?

562
00:43:59,881 --> 00:44:01,669
If you work with me...

563
00:44:01,736 --> 00:44:04,671
then your so-called career here
might improve.

564
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,114
If you don't,
then all I have to do...

565
00:44:10,184 --> 00:44:13,480
is draw a line through your name
rather than under it...

566
00:44:13,544 --> 00:44:14,886
and it's over.

567
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,286
Paul, what is it with you?

568
00:44:17,352 --> 00:44:20,352
I told you to go home to your wife.
That was wrong?

569
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:23,490
What? Don't flatter yourself,
Starling.

570
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,113
That was a long time ago.

571
00:44:26,184 --> 00:44:28,737
Why would I hold that
against you?

572
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,448
And besides...

573
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:35,008
this town is full
of corn pone, country pussy.

574
00:44:36,617 --> 00:44:38,373
That said...

575
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,440
I wouldn't mind having a go with you
right now, if you want to reconsider.

576
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,774
In the gym, anytime. No pads.

577
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,389
Is it possible it went out
with the regular mail?

578
00:44:51,464 --> 00:44:55,425
No, I overnighted it to you.
I filled out the slip myself.

579
00:44:55,496 --> 00:44:57,601
This was the day after your request.

580
00:44:57,672 --> 00:45:00,672
I did it right away.
I don't understand what happened.

581
00:45:00,744 --> 00:45:02,402
You should have it by now.

582
00:45:02,472 --> 00:45:04,676
I don't.
Can you send me another one?

583
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,232
Sure, I'll make another copy
especially for you.

584
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,916
Agent Clarice? Is that right?
Can I call you Clarice?

585
00:45:10,984 --> 00:45:12,325
Agent Starling.

586
00:45:12,392 --> 00:45:15,042
I'd appreciate it.
What's your name?

587
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,836
My name is Franco Benetti.

588
00:45:16,904 --> 00:45:18,846
Agent Franco Benetti.

589
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,156
Thank you very much, Agent Benetti.
Okay.

590
00:45:21,224 --> 00:45:23,680
So I'll send you tomorrow?
All right.

591
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:26,371
Bye-bye.

592
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,480
Nothin', huh?

593
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:30,919
Nothin' yet.
Still waitin' on Florence and London.

594
00:46:06,505 --> 00:46:09,766
The number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.

595
00:46:09,832 --> 00:46:12,134
Please check the number...

596
00:46:33,352 --> 00:46:35,075
Yes?

597
00:46:36,456 --> 00:46:39,238
I have information
about Hannibal Lecter.

598
00:46:39,304 --> 00:46:41,954
Have you shared your information
with the police, sir?

599
00:46:42,024 --> 00:46:44,545
I'm required
to encourage you to do so.

600
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:50,468
Is the reward payable
under special circumstances?

601
00:46:50,536 --> 00:46:52,870
May I suggest you contact
an attorney...

602
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:55,489
before taking any possibly
illegal action?

603
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,560
There's one in Geneva
who's excellent in these matters.

604
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:00,542
May I give you his toll-free number?

605
00:47:00,616 --> 00:47:06,465
The number is 004123317.

606
00:47:06,536 --> 00:47:08,870
Thank you for calling.

607
00:47:26,696 --> 00:47:29,663
Yes. I was just speaking
with someone who suggested...

608
00:47:29,736 --> 00:47:31,874
There's a $ 100,000 advance.

609
00:47:31,944 --> 00:47:33,886
To qualify for the advance...

610
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,928
a fingerprint must be provided,
in situ, on an object.

611
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,295
Once the print
has been positively identified...

612
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,848
the balance of the money
will be placed in escrow...

613
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,676
at Geneve Credit Suisse...

614
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:49,021
and may be viewed at any time
subject to 24-hour prior notification.

615
00:47:49,096 --> 00:47:51,681
To repeat the message in French,
press two.

616
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:54,468
In Spanish, press three.
In German...

617
00:48:20,296 --> 00:48:22,849
Dr. Fell, it's Inspector Pazzi.

618
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,309
Yes, I can see you.

619
00:48:25,384 --> 00:48:27,010
Come on up.

620
00:48:38,536 --> 00:48:40,260
Dr. Fell?

621
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,842
Snap.

622
00:49:19,912 --> 00:49:22,279
I should have encouraged you
to bring someone along.

623
00:49:22,344 --> 00:49:24,286
The cases are on the heavy side.

624
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,629
Maybe you could help me
with them.

625
00:49:27,912 --> 00:49:30,367
Just down the stairs, I mean.

626
00:49:32,232 --> 00:49:33,988
Yeah.

627
00:49:34,056 --> 00:49:36,773
This way.

628
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,142
Here we are.

629
00:49:42,472 --> 00:49:45,025
Is that the inventory?
Yes.

630
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,982
May I see it?
Of course.

631
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:04,258
You are a Pazzi
of the Pazzi family, I think.

632
00:50:05,384 --> 00:50:09,661
Wasn't it at the Palazzo Vecchio
your ancestor was hanged?

633
00:50:09,736 --> 00:50:11,362
Francesco de' Pazzi.

634
00:50:11,432 --> 00:50:14,661
Yes, thrown naked with a noose
around his neck from a window.

635
00:50:15,944 --> 00:50:18,311
Writhing and kicking
alongside the archbishop...

636
00:50:18,376 --> 00:50:21,278
against the cold stone wall.

637
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:24,352
In fact, I found
a very nice rendering of it...

638
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:27,075
here in the library the other day.

639
00:50:27,144 --> 00:50:30,657
If you like, perhaps
I could sneak it out for you.

640
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,690
I would think that might
jeopardize your chances...

641
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,629
for permanent appointment
to the curatorship.

642
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:39,646
Only if you told.

643
00:50:40,936 --> 00:50:43,838
Remind me...
what was his crime?

644
00:50:43,912 --> 00:50:46,562
He was accused of killing
Giuliano de' Medici.

645
00:50:46,631 --> 00:50:47,875
Unjustly?

646
00:50:47,943 --> 00:50:51,555
No, I don't think so.

647
00:50:51,624 --> 00:50:54,472
Then he wasn't just accused.
He did it. He was guilty.

648
00:50:54,536 --> 00:50:58,692
I think that would make living
in Florence with the name Pazzi...

649
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:01,826
uncomfortable,
even 500 years later.

650
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,960
Not really.

651
00:51:05,032 --> 00:51:08,348
In fact, I can't remember
the last time...

652
00:51:08,424 --> 00:51:09,918
before today...

653
00:51:09,992 --> 00:51:11,901
someone brought it up.

654
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,008
People don't always tell you
what they're thinking.

655
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,251
They just see to it you don't...

656
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,255
advance in life.

657
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,433
I'm sorry, Commendatore.

658
00:51:34,504 --> 00:51:36,992
I too often say what I'm thinking.

659
00:51:38,856 --> 00:51:40,711
I'll be right back to help you.

660
00:51:54,631 --> 00:51:59,333
You know, the room you're standing in
was built in the 15th century.

661
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,090
It's beautiful.

662
00:52:02,215 --> 00:52:03,971
Yes, it is.

663
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:06,145
Unfortunately, I think...

664
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:10,045
the heating system was installed
about the same time.

665
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,273
That's a pity.
Yes.

666
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:19,234
Okeydokey.
Let's drag these down.

667
00:52:20,072 --> 00:52:22,657
Must be as heavy as bodies.

668
00:52:50,952 --> 00:52:53,472
And the set?
Eight thousand.

669
00:52:53,544 --> 00:52:54,853
Okay.

670
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:58,567
Hey, how much is this?

671
00:52:58,632 --> 00:53:00,836
Fifty thousand.
I'll take it.

672
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:25,148
Well done.

673
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:37,155
When you go for his wallet,
he'll catch you by the wrist.

674
00:53:37,224 --> 00:53:39,231
I have done this
a few times, Inspector.

675
00:53:39,304 --> 00:53:41,213
Not like this.

676
00:53:42,024 --> 00:53:45,471
If there isn't a clean print
on the bracelet...

677
00:53:45,543 --> 00:53:48,707
you'll spend the summer
in a cell at the Sollicciano.

678
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:53,092
Give me the bracelet.

679
00:53:53,735 --> 00:53:55,645
Wash your fucking hands.

680
00:54:05,224 --> 00:54:07,231
He's coming.

681
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:54,023
I got it.

682
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:01,821
He grabbed me just right.

683
00:56:04,743 --> 00:56:07,231
Tried to hit me in the balls.

684
00:56:11,015 --> 00:56:12,925
But he missed.

685
00:56:17,831 --> 00:56:19,555
Let me help you.

686
00:56:19,624 --> 00:56:21,478
No. Don't.

687
00:57:15,879 --> 00:57:17,854
Sixteen-point match, Mr. Verger.

688
00:57:19,943 --> 00:57:20,991
Bingo.

689
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:41,631
Carlo?
Mason?

690
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:46,428
Well, well, well.

691
00:57:46,503 --> 00:57:50,365
Am I coming to see you?
Yes, soon, I hope.

692
00:57:50,439 --> 00:57:53,887
But first I need you
to pack off the boys.

693
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,967
Now?
Yes, I know.

694
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,757
The day you never
thought would arrive has.

695
00:57:58,824 --> 00:58:01,279
Now, Cordell will fax
the veterinary forms...

696
00:58:01,351 --> 00:58:04,384
directly to
Animal and Plant Health...

697
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:06,397
but you need to get
the vet affidavits...

698
00:58:06,471 --> 00:58:08,032
from Sardinia.

699
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:13,277
How are they?

700
00:58:13,351 --> 00:58:15,773
They are big, Mason,
very big.

701
00:58:22,503 --> 00:58:25,286
Say again?
Yeah, they are big, Mason.

702
00:58:25,351 --> 00:58:29,093
Really big.
Maybe 270 kilos.

703
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:31,548
Oh, wow.

704
00:58:31,623 --> 00:58:33,150
Can you hear?

705
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,072
They sound fantastic.

706
00:58:56,743 --> 00:58:57,953
Super.

707
00:59:31,463 --> 00:59:36,449
The full balance of the money is payable
upon receipt of the doctor, alive.

708
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:39,007
Of course, you won't have to
seize him yourself.

709
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,901
Rather, just point him out.

710
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:45,729
It's preferable to all concerned if
that's the extent of your involvement...

711
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:47,392
from this point.

712
00:59:47,463 --> 00:59:51,391
I prefer to stay involved,
make sure things go right.

713
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,318
Professionals will see to that.

714
00:59:55,271 --> 00:59:56,930
I am a professional.

715
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,119
Did you enjoy the performance,
Commendatore?

716
01:02:16,194 --> 01:02:18,049
Very much.

717
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:22,337
Allegra, this is Dr. Fell,
curator of the Capponi Library.

718
01:02:22,402 --> 01:02:23,679
Signora Pazzi.

719
01:02:23,746 --> 01:02:25,601
I'm honored.

720
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:27,521
Are you from America,
Doctor?

721
01:02:27,586 --> 01:02:30,139
Not originally.
I've travelled there.

722
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:33,112
I've always wanted to visit.
New England, especially.

723
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:35,869
I've enjoyed many
excellent meals there.

724
01:02:37,026 --> 01:02:40,441
I noticed you wrapped up
in the libretto.

725
01:02:40,514 --> 01:02:42,369
Thought this might amuse you.

726
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:47,201
Dante's first sonnet
from La Vita Nuova.

727
01:02:47,266 --> 01:02:49,121
It's beautiful.

728
01:02:50,306 --> 01:02:53,121
Rinaldo, look at this.
I can see.

729
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:56,797
"Joyous Love seemed to me...

730
01:02:56,866 --> 01:02:59,834
the while he held
my heart in his hands...

731
01:02:59,906 --> 01:03:01,597
and in his arms...

732
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:03,968
my lady lay asleep...

733
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:05,889
wrapped in a veil."

734
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,060
"He woke her then...

735
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:12,735
and trembling and obedient, she ate
that burning heart out of his hand.

736
01:03:12,802 --> 01:03:14,874
Weeping, I saw him
then depart from me."

737
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:20,636
Dr. Fell, do you believe a man could
become so obsessed with a woman...

738
01:03:20,706 --> 01:03:23,194
from a single encounter?

739
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:26,081
Could he daily feel
a stab of hunger for her...

740
01:03:26,146 --> 01:03:28,961
and find nourishment
in the very sight of her?

741
01:03:29,026 --> 01:03:31,164
I think so.

742
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:35,490
But would she see through the bars
of his plight and ache for him?

743
01:03:35,554 --> 01:03:37,758
Please keep that.
I couldn't.

744
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:39,353
I insist.

745
01:03:49,442 --> 01:03:50,554
Good-bye.

746
01:03:52,066 --> 01:03:54,881
Let's get something to eat.
Of course.

747
01:03:54,946 --> 01:03:56,801
Why not?

748
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:29,880
Is that you, Doctor?

749
01:05:18,562 --> 01:05:21,431
I'd like to speak with
Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi, please.

750
01:05:21,506 --> 01:05:24,605
This is Agent Clarice Starling
from the American FBI.

751
01:05:24,674 --> 01:05:25,917
One moment.

752
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:31,201
FBI.
I'm not here.

753
01:05:35,842 --> 01:05:36,954
Inspector Pazzi.

754
01:05:37,026 --> 01:05:39,776
It's Agent Starling
from the FBI. How do you do?

755
01:05:39,842 --> 01:05:43,322
Actually, I was just
leaving for the day.

756
01:05:43,394 --> 01:05:45,434
Can I call you back tomorrow?
This won't take long.

757
01:05:45,506 --> 01:05:50,394
First, thank you for sending us the
security tape from the perfume store.

758
01:05:50,466 --> 01:05:53,979
When I say "you,"I mean
your department... Agent Benetti.

759
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:57,116
Is he there?
Can I speak with him?

760
01:05:57,186 --> 01:06:00,001
I'm sorry. He's gone home.
That's all right.

761
01:06:00,066 --> 01:06:02,237
I should tell you this
rather than him anyway.

762
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:04,543
I'm late for
an important appointment.

763
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:07,130
The person I'm looking for,
Inspector...

764
01:06:07,202 --> 01:06:10,072
who is indeed shown on that tape,
is Hannibal Lecter.

765
01:06:10,145 --> 01:06:11,672
Who?

766
01:06:11,746 --> 01:06:14,561
Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
You've never heard of him?

767
01:06:14,626 --> 01:06:18,238
I'm not familiar.
And the tape confirms...

768
01:06:18,306 --> 01:06:20,794
that he is
or was recently in Florence.

769
01:06:22,434 --> 01:06:25,336
Really?
He's a very dangerous man, Inspector.

770
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:28,639
He's killed 14 people
that we know of.

771
01:06:28,706 --> 01:06:30,975
I really have to go, Miss...
Starling.

772
01:06:31,042 --> 01:06:32,635
Just another minute.

773
01:06:32,706 --> 01:06:35,521
You sure you've never heard of him?
No, I haven't.

774
01:06:35,586 --> 01:06:37,441
Because I'm confused.

775
01:06:37,506 --> 01:06:41,761
Someone there has been accessing
our private VICAP files on Dr. Lecter...

776
01:06:41,825 --> 01:06:44,728
with some regularity
on your computer.

777
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:48,576
Everybody uses
everybody's computer here.

778
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:51,456
Maybe one of the detectives
on II Mostro...

779
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:53,409
was looking at
profiles of killers...

780
01:06:53,474 --> 01:06:55,841
I'm speaking about the computer
at your home, sir.

781
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,695
You're trying to catch him yourself,
aren't you? For the reward.

782
01:07:00,769 --> 01:07:03,257
I cannot warn you
strongly enough against that.

783
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:06,080
He killed three policemen
down in Memphis while in custody...

784
01:07:06,146 --> 01:07:09,724
tearing the face off one of them,
and he will kill you too.

785
01:07:43,074 --> 01:07:46,335
I want him out of Tuscany fast.
Believe me...

786
01:07:46,401 --> 01:07:49,249
he'll be gone
from the face of the earth fast.

787
01:07:49,314 --> 01:07:50,841
Feetfirst.

788
01:08:09,826 --> 01:08:13,241
Because of his avarice and his betrayal
of the emperor's trust...

789
01:08:13,314 --> 01:08:17,405
Pier della Vigna was disgraced,
blinded and imprisoned.

790
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:22,841
Dante's pilgrim finds Pier della Vigna
on the seventh level of the Inferno...

791
01:08:22,914 --> 01:08:26,230
and, likeJudas Iscariot,
he died by hanging.

792
01:08:26,306 --> 01:08:29,056
SoJudas and Pier della Vigna
are linked in Dante...

793
01:08:29,122 --> 01:08:31,358
by the avarice
he saw in them.

794
01:08:31,425 --> 01:08:35,616
In fact, avarice and hanging
are linked in the medieval mind.

795
01:08:35,682 --> 01:08:38,943
This is the earliest known
depiction of the Crucifixion...

796
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:43,133
carved on an ivory box in Gaul
about A.D. 400.

797
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:47,839
It includes the death
by hanging ofJudas...

798
01:08:47,906 --> 01:08:49,760
his face upturned
to the branch that suspends him.

799
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:52,695
Here he is again on the doors
of the Benevento Cathedral...

800
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:56,479
this time
with his bowels falling out.

801
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:06,526
It wasn't easy, but I got this number
without tellin'them why...

802
01:09:06,593 --> 01:09:08,895
Sorry.
Not at all. Welcome.

803
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:12,158
Please join us.
Thank you.

804
01:09:12,226 --> 01:09:15,041
On this plate from the
15th-century edition of the Inferno...

805
01:09:15,106 --> 01:09:18,488
Pier della Vigna's body
hangs from a bleeding tree.

806
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:21,376
I will not belabor the obvious
parallel with Judas Iscariot...

807
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:24,256
but Dante Alighieri
needed no drawn illustration.

808
01:09:24,321 --> 01:09:28,729
It was his genius to make
Pier della Vigna, now in hell...

809
01:09:28,802 --> 01:09:31,617
speak in strained hisses
and coughing sibilants...

810
01:09:31,682 --> 01:09:34,432
as though
he is hanging still.

811
01:09:58,114 --> 01:10:00,383
Avarice, hanging...

812
01:10:00,449 --> 01:10:01,944
self-destruction.

813
01:10:06,146 --> 01:10:08,285
"I make my own home...

814
01:10:09,314 --> 01:10:11,169
be my gallows."

815
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:15,579
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your kind attention.

816
01:10:30,913 --> 01:10:33,913
I'm not a scholar,
but I think you've got the job.

817
01:10:33,986 --> 01:10:35,196
Thank you.

818
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:38,080
May I buy you a drink?
How kind of you. I'd like that.

819
01:10:38,145 --> 01:10:40,960
I'll be a minute
gathering my things.

820
01:10:41,025 --> 01:10:42,935
Take your time.

821
01:10:52,162 --> 01:10:56,155
Allegra, I'll be home
just a little later than I said.

822
01:10:56,225 --> 01:10:58,135
I'm taking Dr. Fell out
for a drink.

823
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:03,673
I can see the people
coming out now.

824
01:11:05,825 --> 01:11:08,411
Yes. Bye, honey. My wife.

825
01:11:08,482 --> 01:11:10,042
Of course.

826
01:11:12,353 --> 01:11:14,939
I should have shown them
this one.

827
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:18,654
I can't imagine how I missed it.
Remember? I told you about it.

828
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:21,242
It's a rendering
I found in the Capponi Library.

829
01:11:21,314 --> 01:11:23,964
Can you make it out?

830
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:26,684
There's a name there...

831
01:11:26,753 --> 01:11:28,761
the one I told you about.

832
01:11:41,249 --> 01:11:43,289
It's your ancestor,
Commendatore...

833
01:11:43,361 --> 01:11:45,849
hanging beneath
these very windows.

834
01:11:45,922 --> 01:11:47,710
Francesco de' Pazzi.

835
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:52,377
On a related subject,
I must confess to you...

836
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:54,905
I'm giving very serious thought...

837
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:02,679
to eating your wife.

838
01:12:34,626 --> 01:12:37,528
If you tell me what I need to know,
Commendatore...

839
01:12:37,601 --> 01:12:40,089
it might be convenient for me
to leave Florence without my meal.

840
01:12:40,161 --> 01:12:43,609
So I'll ask you the questions,
and then we'll see. All right?

841
01:12:43,682 --> 01:12:44,958
Okay?

842
01:12:57,026 --> 01:12:58,236
So.

843
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:03,168
Now, is it Mason Verger
you sold me to?

844
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:06,775
No, no.

845
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,954
Blink twice for yes,
once for no.

846
01:13:09,025 --> 01:13:11,481
Was it Mason Verger
you sold me to?

847
01:13:13,026 --> 01:13:14,880
Yes, good. Thank you.

848
01:13:14,946 --> 01:13:17,760
And are his men
waiting for me outside?

849
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:21,432
Was that a single blink?

850
01:13:21,505 --> 01:13:23,328
You're confused.

851
01:13:23,394 --> 01:13:27,355
Please don't be confused, because I may
have to fillet Signora Pazzi after all.

852
01:13:30,401 --> 01:13:32,768
Have you told anyone
in the questura about me?

853
01:13:34,241 --> 01:13:36,064
No, I thought not.

854
01:13:36,705 --> 01:13:39,640
Have you told Allegra?

855
01:13:42,049 --> 01:13:43,958
No? Are you sure?

856
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,515
I believe you.

857
01:13:49,985 --> 01:13:52,287
Okeydokey, here we go.

858
01:13:58,562 --> 01:13:59,739
Okay.

859
01:14:01,282 --> 01:14:02,808
Your heart is really palpitating.

860
01:14:02,881 --> 01:14:05,663
Oh, it's not your heart.

861
01:14:07,554 --> 01:14:09,594
Shall I answer it?

862
01:14:11,842 --> 01:14:14,395
I've gone above you.
I've spoken to your section chief.

863
01:14:14,465 --> 01:14:17,116
Someday you'll thank me.
Or you won't. I don't care.

864
01:14:17,185 --> 01:14:19,454
You'll be alive.

865
01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:21,310
Inspector Pazzi?

866
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:24,445
Is this Clarice?

867
01:14:24,513 --> 01:14:26,880
Hello, Clarice.

868
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:29,758
I'm afraid I have
bad news for you.

869
01:14:29,825 --> 01:14:32,859
Is he dead?
Did you get my note?

870
01:14:32,929 --> 01:14:35,482
I hope you like the skin cream.
I had it specially made for you.

871
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,409
Is he dead, Dr. Lecter?

872
01:14:37,474 --> 01:14:41,435
I would love nothing more in this world
than to be able to chat with you.

873
01:14:41,506 --> 01:14:44,572
Unfortunately, you've caught me
at an awkward moment.

874
01:14:44,642 --> 01:14:46,813
Please forgive me.

875
01:14:46,881 --> 01:14:48,539
See you around.

876
01:14:50,721 --> 01:14:52,630
An old friend.

877
01:14:56,481 --> 01:14:57,975
Okay, hold on.

878
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:01,024
Here we go.

879
01:15:32,034 --> 01:15:35,994
I'll go around back!
Kill him if you have to!

880
01:15:39,073 --> 01:15:40,960
What's it to be?

881
01:15:41,026 --> 01:15:43,131
Bowels in or bowels out...

882
01:15:43,202 --> 01:15:45,111
likeJudas?

883
01:15:45,185 --> 01:15:46,974
Are you confused?

884
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,759
I'll decide for you,
if you'll permit me.

885
01:17:00,321 --> 01:17:01,565
Good evening.

886
01:18:06,146 --> 01:18:08,601
Cordell...

887
01:18:08,674 --> 01:18:10,528
to you...

888
01:18:10,594 --> 01:18:13,823
does that look
like a wave good-bye...

889
01:18:15,073 --> 01:18:17,408
or hello?

890
01:19:00,705 --> 01:19:03,771
So, what do you think?

891
01:19:03,841 --> 01:19:08,730
Does Lecter want to fuck her
or kill her or eat her or what?

892
01:19:08,801 --> 01:19:11,288
Probably all three.

893
01:19:11,361 --> 01:19:13,882
Though I wouldn't want
to predict in what order.

894
01:19:15,393 --> 01:19:17,881
Here's what I think.

895
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:21,881
No matter how Barney
might want to romanticize it...

896
01:19:21,953 --> 01:19:25,695
and make it
Beauty and the Beast...

897
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,795
Lecter's object, as I know
from personal experience...

898
01:19:28,865 --> 01:19:31,003
has always been...

899
01:19:31,073 --> 01:19:33,113
degradation...

900
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,356
and suffering.

901
01:19:35,425 --> 01:19:39,997
Get this damn thing off me.
I can't breathe in this thing.

902
01:19:42,465 --> 01:19:45,531
He comes in the guise
of a mentor...

903
01:19:45,601 --> 01:19:48,863
as he did with me and her.

904
01:19:48,929 --> 01:19:52,726
But it's distress that excites him.

905
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:54,624
To draw him...

906
01:19:55,905 --> 01:19:58,239
she needs to be distressed.

907
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:05,119
To make her attractive to him,
let him see her distressed.

908
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:09,656
Let the damage he sees...

909
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:12,599
suggest the damage
he could do.

910
01:20:21,569 --> 01:20:25,147
When the fox hears the rabbit scream,
he comes a-runnin'.

911
01:20:26,881 --> 01:20:28,790
But not to help.

912
01:20:28,865 --> 01:20:30,720
I don't understand.

913
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:32,858
There's nothing
to understand, Paul.

914
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:36,606
All you have to understand
is what it's worth to you.

915
01:20:36,673 --> 01:20:39,487
No, no, I don't understand
why she didn't turn this over.

916
01:20:39,553 --> 01:20:41,440
I mean, she's such
a straight arrow.

917
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:44,767
She didn't turn it over
because she didn't receive it.

918
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:46,808
She didn't receive it
because it was never sent.

919
01:20:46,881 --> 01:20:49,215
It was never sent because
Lecter didn't write it.

920
01:20:49,281 --> 01:20:51,736
He didn't write it
because I did.

921
01:20:56,833 --> 01:20:58,687
So, what do you think?

922
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:02,048
You'd have been better off if
you'd never got her out of trouble.

923
01:21:02,113 --> 01:21:05,975
Oh, woulda, shoulda, coulda. I meant,
what do you think about the money?

924
01:21:06,049 --> 01:21:07,161
Five.

925
01:21:08,193 --> 01:21:12,449
Let's just toss it off, like "five."

926
01:21:12,513 --> 01:21:15,360
Let's say it
with the respect it deserves.

927
01:21:15,425 --> 01:21:18,294
Five hundred thousand dollars.

928
01:21:18,369 --> 01:21:20,157
That's better, but not much.

929
01:21:20,225 --> 01:21:22,559
Now, will it work?
It'll work.

930
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:24,698
It won't be pretty.

931
01:21:24,768 --> 01:21:26,678
What ever is?

932
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:32,090
Cocksucker.

933
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:35,008
Never seen this before
in my life.

934
01:21:35,073 --> 01:21:39,296
Then how do you account for its being
found in your office, your basement?

935
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:42,176
How do you want me to answer that,
Mr. Krendler?

936
01:21:42,241 --> 01:21:45,056
What possible reason
might I have to withhold it?

937
01:21:45,121 --> 01:21:48,253
Perhaps because of the nature
of its content.

938
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:51,168
Reads to me like a love letter.

939
01:21:51,233 --> 01:21:54,200
Has it been tested for prints?
No prints on it. None on the last one.

940
01:21:54,273 --> 01:21:56,096
Handwriting analysis?

941
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:59,641
"Did you ever think, Clarice, why
the philistines don't understand you?

942
01:21:59,713 --> 01:22:01,917
It's because you're the answer
to Samson's riddle.

943
01:22:01,985 --> 01:22:03,992
You are the honey in the lion."

944
01:22:04,065 --> 01:22:05,527
Sounds like him to me.

945
01:22:05,601 --> 01:22:09,724
Do you mean, like a homosexual?
Like a nut with a crush.

946
01:22:09,793 --> 01:22:11,102
Director Noonan,
I need to say something...

947
01:22:11,169 --> 01:22:13,558
Agent Starling, I am placing you
on administrative leave...

948
01:22:13,633 --> 01:22:17,659
till document analysis tells me
unequivocally a mistake's been made.

949
01:22:17,729 --> 01:22:20,795
In the meantime, you remain eligible
for insurance and medical benefits.

950
01:22:20,865 --> 01:22:23,832
Surrender your weapons and
your identification to Agent Pearsall.

951
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:39,480
I want to say something.
I think I'm entitled.

952
01:22:39,549 --> 01:22:41,240
Go ahead.

953
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:44,659
I think Mr. Mason Verger is
trying to capture Dr. Lecter...

954
01:22:44,734 --> 01:22:46,643
for the purposes
of personal revenge.

955
01:22:46,718 --> 01:22:49,140
I think Mr. Krendler
is in collusion with him...

956
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:52,028
and wants the FBI's efforts against
Dr. Lecter to work for Mr. Verger.

957
01:22:52,094 --> 01:22:54,843
I think Mr. Krendler
is being paid to do this.

958
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:58,488
Lucky you're not sworn here today.
Swear me! You swear too!

959
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:01,208
Clarice,
if the evidence is lacking...

960
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:03,798
you'll be entitled to full reinstatement
without prejudice...

961
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:08,125
if you don't do or say
anything in the meantime...

962
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:10,612
that would make that impossible.

963
01:23:10,814 --> 01:23:14,011
Relieved of field duty pending
an internal investigation...

964
01:23:14,078 --> 01:23:16,925
Special Agent Clarice Starling,
a ten-year veteran on the Bureau...

965
01:23:16,989 --> 01:23:18,964
began her career
with an assignment...

966
01:23:19,038 --> 01:23:21,045
to interview lethal madman
Hannibal Lecter.

967
01:23:21,118 --> 01:23:24,795
Earlier, we heard comments from Justice
Department spokesman Paul Krendler.

968
01:23:25,885 --> 01:23:29,017
Can you comment on theJustice
Department's decision this morning?

969
01:23:29,086 --> 01:23:33,014
The FBI and theJustice Department are
looking very carefully into the charges.

970
01:23:33,086 --> 01:23:35,322
And, yes, they are extremely serious.

971
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:36,851
I'd like to add
a personal note, though.

972
01:23:36,926 --> 01:23:41,366
Starling's one of our best agents.
No, no, no, stay.

973
01:23:41,438 --> 01:23:45,300
I would be very surprised if these
accusations turn out to be true.

974
01:23:45,374 --> 01:23:48,690
Is theJustice Department and FBI
united in this decision?

975
01:23:48,765 --> 01:23:51,351
It's much too soon to condemn her...

976
01:24:34,749 --> 01:24:36,407
Good boy.

977
01:27:11,966 --> 01:27:14,267
I think she's nice.

978
01:27:14,334 --> 01:27:17,083
She's always been nice to me.
Polite.

979
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:18,611
Don't you think?

980
01:27:18,686 --> 01:27:21,500
Do you know what
a roller pigeon is, Barney?

981
01:27:21,566 --> 01:27:23,802
Roller pigeons
climb high and fast...

982
01:27:23,869 --> 01:27:26,837
then roll over and fall
just as fast towards the Earth.

983
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:30,139
There are shallow rollers
and there are deep rollers...

984
01:27:30,206 --> 01:27:33,501
but you can't breed two deep rollers,
or their young, their offspring...

985
01:27:33,565 --> 01:27:36,860
will roll all the way down,
hit and die.

986
01:27:36,926 --> 01:27:40,755
Agent Starling is a deep roller.

987
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:43,645
Let's hope
one of her parents was not.

988
01:29:10,206 --> 01:29:12,540
The power in that battery
is low, Clarice.

989
01:29:12,605 --> 01:29:15,223
I would've changed it,
but I didn't want to wake you.

990
01:29:15,293 --> 01:29:19,450
Use the one in the charger. Hopefully,
the light on it is green by now.

991
01:29:19,517 --> 01:29:22,135
Because this is gonna be a long call
and I can't let you off...

992
01:29:22,205 --> 01:29:24,540
because even though
you've been stripped of your duties...

993
01:29:24,606 --> 01:29:27,770
I know you won't abandon them...
you'll try to put on a trace.

994
01:29:27,838 --> 01:29:31,318
So we'll disconnect long enough for you
to exchange the battery in the phone...

995
01:29:31,389 --> 01:29:33,331
for the one in the charger.

996
01:29:33,405 --> 01:29:36,274
Shall we say, three seconds?

997
01:29:36,349 --> 01:29:37,843
Are you ready?
Yes.

998
01:29:37,917 --> 01:29:38,845
Go.

999
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:45,980
Very good.
Thank you.

1000
01:29:46,045 --> 01:29:48,860
Remember, Clarice, if you get caught
with a concealed, unlicensed firearm...

1001
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:51,642
in the District of Columbia,
the penalty is very stiff.

1002
01:29:51,709 --> 01:29:55,157
But bring the guns if you have to.
Now get in your car.

1003
01:30:30,653 --> 01:30:32,824
The reason we're doing it
like this, Clarice...

1004
01:30:32,893 --> 01:30:36,755
is because I like to watch you
as we speak, with your eyes open.

1005
01:30:37,918 --> 01:30:41,398
No, it does not excite me.
It pleases me.

1006
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:43,803
You have very shapely feet.

1007
01:30:46,845 --> 01:30:49,333
Where are we now?
Call it out.

1008
01:30:49,405 --> 01:30:51,128
Massachusetts Avenue.

1009
01:30:51,197 --> 01:30:53,020
Take it.

1010
01:30:53,085 --> 01:30:56,729
I thought, to begin with,
you might tell me how you're feeling.

1011
01:30:56,797 --> 01:30:57,725
About what?

1012
01:30:57,789 --> 01:31:00,571
The masters you serve
and how they've treated you.

1013
01:31:00,637 --> 01:31:03,255
Your career, such as it is.

1014
01:31:03,325 --> 01:31:05,148
Your life, Clarice.

1015
01:31:05,213 --> 01:31:07,100
I thought we might
talk about yours.

1016
01:31:07,165 --> 01:31:10,035
What's the next cross street?
Capitol Street.

1017
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:14,201
In two blocks, make a left
into Union Station. Park.

1018
01:31:15,453 --> 01:31:17,788
My life? What is there
to say about mine?

1019
01:31:17,853 --> 01:31:20,820
I have been in a state of hibernation
for some time...

1020
01:31:20,893 --> 01:31:22,900
a little inactive.

1021
01:31:22,973 --> 01:31:26,137
But now I'm back home
and I'm very happy...

1022
01:31:26,205 --> 01:31:27,863
and very healthy.

1023
01:31:27,933 --> 01:31:32,123
You. It's you I'm worried about.
I'm fine.

1024
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:34,907
No, you're certainly
not fine, Clarice.

1025
01:31:34,973 --> 01:31:37,558
You fell in love with the Bureau,
the institution...

1026
01:31:37,629 --> 01:31:40,891
only to discover, after giving it
everything you've got...

1027
01:31:40,957 --> 01:31:42,964
that it does not
love you back...

1028
01:31:43,037 --> 01:31:44,979
that, in fact, it resents you.

1029
01:31:45,053 --> 01:31:47,901
It resents you more than the husband
and children you gave up to it.

1030
01:31:47,965 --> 01:31:52,242
Why is that, do you think?
Why are you so resented?

1031
01:31:52,317 --> 01:31:54,684
Tell me.
Tell you?

1032
01:31:54,749 --> 01:31:56,342
God bless you.

1033
01:31:56,413 --> 01:31:58,202
Well, isn't it clear?

1034
01:31:59,869 --> 01:32:03,165
You serve the idea
of order, Clarice.

1035
01:32:03,229 --> 01:32:04,571
They don't.

1036
01:32:04,637 --> 01:32:08,085
You believe in the oath you took.
They don't.

1037
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:12,380
You feel it is your duty
to protect the sheep. They don't.

1038
01:32:12,445 --> 01:32:14,485
They don't like you
because you're not like them.

1039
01:32:14,557 --> 01:32:16,696
They hate you and envy you.

1040
01:32:16,765 --> 01:32:20,377
They are weak, unruly
and believe in nothing.

1041
01:32:20,445 --> 01:32:22,900
Mason Verger wants to kill you,
Dr. Lecter.

1042
01:32:22,973 --> 01:32:25,624
Turn yourself in to me,
and I promise no one will hurt you.

1043
01:32:25,694 --> 01:32:29,076
Will you stay with me in my prison cell
and hold my hand, Clarice?

1044
01:32:29,149 --> 01:32:31,418
We could have some fun.

1045
01:32:31,485 --> 01:32:34,802
No, Mason Verger does not want to kill
me any more than I want to kill him.

1046
01:32:34,877 --> 01:32:38,652
He just wants to see me suffer
in some unimaginable way.

1047
01:32:38,717 --> 01:32:40,757
He is rather twisted,
you know.

1048
01:32:40,829 --> 01:32:43,218
Have you had the pleasure
of meeting him?

1049
01:32:43,293 --> 01:32:45,398
Face-to-face, so to speak?

1050
01:32:45,469 --> 01:32:47,324
Yes.

1051
01:32:47,389 --> 01:32:50,389
Attractive, isn't he?
Dr. Lecter?

1052
01:32:54,685 --> 01:32:56,595
Okay, back to you.

1053
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:58,841
I want to know what it is
you think you will do...

1054
01:32:58,909 --> 01:33:02,138
now that everything you've ever cared
about has been taken away from you.

1055
01:33:02,205 --> 01:33:04,539
I don't know, Dr. Lecter.

1056
01:33:04,605 --> 01:33:07,322
Clarice, do you think you'll work
as a chambermaid...

1057
01:33:07,389 --> 01:33:10,040
at a motel on Route 66...

1058
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:12,728
just like your mommy?

1059
01:33:21,597 --> 01:33:23,604
What are you thinking now?

1060
01:33:23,677 --> 01:33:27,539
Are you paying attention to me,
ex-Special Agent Starling?

1061
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:31,546
Are you, by any chance,
trying to trace my whereabouts?

1062
01:33:35,453 --> 01:33:38,770
I'm being followed, Dr. Lecter.
I know. I've seen them.

1063
01:33:38,845 --> 01:33:41,627
And now you're in
a real dilemma, aren't you?

1064
01:33:41,693 --> 01:33:45,370
Do you continue to try to find me,
knowing that you are leading them to me?

1065
01:33:45,437 --> 01:33:48,917
Do you have so much faith in your
abilities that you honestly believe...

1066
01:33:48,989 --> 01:33:52,699
you can somehow simultaneously
arrest me and them?

1067
01:33:52,765 --> 01:33:56,562
It could get very messy, Clarice,
like the fish market.

1068
01:33:58,205 --> 01:34:00,758
What if I did it for you?
Did what?

1069
01:34:00,829 --> 01:34:04,245
Harmed them, Clarice,
the ones who have harmed you.

1070
01:34:04,317 --> 01:34:07,481
What if I made them
scream apologies?

1071
01:34:07,549 --> 01:34:09,491
No, I shouldn't even say it...

1072
01:34:09,565 --> 01:34:12,827
because you'll feel, with your
perfect grasp of right and wrong...

1073
01:34:12,893 --> 01:34:15,032
that you were somehow accompli.

1074
01:34:16,285 --> 01:34:17,714
Don't help me.

1075
01:34:19,165 --> 01:34:21,075
No, of course not.
Forget I said it.

1076
01:34:25,853 --> 01:34:28,536
Clarice, you were very,
very warm.

1077
01:34:28,605 --> 01:34:30,515
You were so close.

1078
01:34:34,557 --> 01:34:37,372
And now you're getting
colder again.

1079
01:34:37,437 --> 01:34:39,576
Yeah, warmer again.

1080
01:34:39,645 --> 01:34:43,638
Well, I think I've been generous
enough with you and the clues.

1081
01:34:43,709 --> 01:34:47,058
You're on your own now, Clarice.
Dr. Lecter.

1082
01:34:55,965 --> 01:34:58,583
Hope you like them, Clarice.
Ta-ta.

1083
01:35:27,293 --> 01:35:28,787
Go.

1084
01:35:44,637 --> 01:35:46,492
Get out of the way!

1085
01:35:57,597 --> 01:36:00,347
I know the first thing a hysteric
says is, "I am not a hysteric"...

1086
01:36:00,413 --> 01:36:03,577
but I am not a hysteric.
I am calm.

1087
01:36:03,645 --> 01:36:06,395
I'll ask you one time.
Think before you answer.

1088
01:36:07,613 --> 01:36:10,460
Think about every good thing
you ever did.

1089
01:36:10,525 --> 01:36:12,347
Think about what you swore.

1090
01:36:12,413 --> 01:36:15,576
Two men in a van,
a third driving, another man down.

1091
01:36:15,644 --> 01:36:18,100
They put him in the back.
I think it was Lecter.

1092
01:36:18,173 --> 01:36:21,402
I gave you a license, and I'm reporting
it to you again in front of witnesses.

1093
01:36:23,357 --> 01:36:24,917
All right.

1094
01:36:26,013 --> 01:36:27,922
I'll go with it as a kidnapping.

1095
01:36:28,573 --> 01:36:30,581
I'll send someone
with the local authorities...

1096
01:36:30,653 --> 01:36:32,856
if they'll let us on the property
without a warrant.

1097
01:36:32,924 --> 01:36:37,081
I should go. You could deputize me.
No. You're not going.

1098
01:36:37,149 --> 01:36:39,735
You're going home,
where you'll wait for me to call...

1099
01:36:39,805 --> 01:36:43,350
and tell you what,
if anything, we've found.

1100
01:36:44,605 --> 01:36:47,768
Thank Mr. Verger for letting us look
around. Sorry if we inconvenienced him.

1101
01:36:47,837 --> 01:36:49,844
He's always happy to see you.

1102
01:36:59,037 --> 01:37:01,012
Phone.

1103
01:37:01,085 --> 01:37:03,573
What number, please?

1104
01:37:03,644 --> 01:37:04,954
Carlo.

1105
01:37:12,445 --> 01:37:13,939
Give me one.

1106
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:20,732
How is he?
Sleeping.

1107
01:37:20,797 --> 01:37:23,448
Bring him home.

1108
01:37:45,565 --> 01:37:48,881
You've reached Clarice Starling.
Please leave a message.

1109
01:37:48,957 --> 01:37:50,451
Pick up, Starling.

1110
01:37:50,525 --> 01:37:52,413
There was nothing out there.

1111
01:37:52,477 --> 01:37:54,811
I'm gonna say it again,
in case you didn't hear me.

1112
01:37:54,877 --> 01:37:58,652
You are not a law officer while
you're on suspension. You'reJoe Blow.

1113
01:37:59,773 --> 01:38:02,643
Hope for your sake
you're in the bathroom.

1114
01:38:40,189 --> 01:38:41,782
Hylochoerus...

1115
01:38:41,853 --> 01:38:44,886
meinertzhageni.

1116
01:38:44,956 --> 01:38:48,885
Ring any bells from
high school biology, Doctor?

1117
01:38:49,917 --> 01:38:51,771
No?

1118
01:38:51,837 --> 01:38:55,284
Well, I could list
its most conspicuous features...

1119
01:38:55,357 --> 01:38:58,008
if that would help
jog the memory.

1120
01:38:58,717 --> 01:39:01,532
Three pairs of incisors...

1121
01:39:01,597 --> 01:39:06,005
one pair of elongated canines...

1122
01:39:07,453 --> 01:39:10,649
three pairs of molars...

1123
01:39:10,717 --> 01:39:13,172
four pairs of premolars...

1124
01:39:13,244 --> 01:39:15,448
upper and lower...

1125
01:39:15,517 --> 01:39:20,252
for a total of 44 teeth.

1126
01:39:24,829 --> 01:39:29,531
The meal will begin with
an hors d'oeuvres tartare...

1127
01:39:30,909 --> 01:39:33,527
your feet.

1128
01:39:33,597 --> 01:39:35,539
The main course...
the rest of you...

1129
01:39:35,613 --> 01:39:39,126
won't be served
until seven hours later.

1130
01:39:39,197 --> 01:39:41,368
But during that time...

1131
01:39:41,437 --> 01:39:45,692
you'll be able to enjoy the effects
of the consumed appetizer...

1132
01:39:45,757 --> 01:39:49,052
with a full-bodied saline drip.

1133
01:39:51,005 --> 01:39:54,136
I guess you wish now...

1134
01:39:54,205 --> 01:39:56,660
you'd fed the rest of me
to the dogs.

1135
01:39:58,077 --> 01:40:00,019
No, Mason.

1136
01:40:00,605 --> 01:40:03,060
No, I much prefer you
the way you are.

1137
01:40:04,124 --> 01:40:05,553
So...

1138
01:40:07,133 --> 01:40:08,988
dinner at 8:00.

1139
01:40:35,677 --> 01:40:39,157
You will stay
for the evening's entertainment...

1140
01:40:39,229 --> 01:40:40,920
won't you, Cordell?

1141
01:40:40,989 --> 01:40:43,477
If it's all right with you...

1142
01:40:43,548 --> 01:40:46,199
I think I'd rather not.

1143
01:40:46,268 --> 01:40:48,373
Rather not...

1144
01:40:48,444 --> 01:40:51,128
or will not?

1145
01:42:49,885 --> 01:42:53,846
Your little brother must smell
almost as badly as you do by now.

1146
01:43:20,476 --> 01:43:22,713
Hold it!
Hands where I can see 'em!

1147
01:43:27,292 --> 01:43:28,569
Quiet!

1148
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:36,371
What was that?

1149
01:43:36,444 --> 01:43:37,655
Cordell, quickly!

1150
01:43:37,725 --> 01:43:40,692
Get on your stomach.

1151
01:43:40,765 --> 01:43:42,291
Good evening, Clarice.

1152
01:43:42,364 --> 01:43:45,266
Just like old times.
Shut up.

1153
01:43:47,037 --> 01:43:49,208
Can you walk?
I can try.

1154
01:43:52,156 --> 01:43:53,618
You look well.

1155
01:43:53,693 --> 01:43:55,635
I'm gonna cut you loose.

1156
01:43:55,708 --> 01:43:58,807
If you touch me,
I'll shoot you.

1157
01:43:58,876 --> 01:44:01,975
Understood.
Do right and you'll live through this.

1158
01:44:02,045 --> 01:44:04,892
Spoken like a true Protestant.
Better hurry.

1159
01:44:04,956 --> 01:44:07,291
Things might go faster
if you hand me the knife.

1160
01:44:07,357 --> 01:44:09,724
There was a third
in the loft.

1161
01:44:09,788 --> 01:44:13,203
No, Clarice. Behind me.

1162
01:44:49,437 --> 01:44:53,015
Cordell, shoot him!
Get the gun and shoot him!

1163
01:44:53,084 --> 01:44:55,418
Go into the pen?
Yes!

1164
01:44:55,484 --> 01:44:57,656
No. I'm staying out of this.

1165
01:44:57,725 --> 01:45:01,554
You're involved, is what you are,
in all of it. Now do it!

1166
01:45:01,628 --> 01:45:02,643
No.
Yes!

1167
01:45:02,717 --> 01:45:05,684
Hey, Cordell,
why don't you push him in?

1168
01:45:05,757 --> 01:45:07,797
You can always say
it was me.

1169
01:46:49,852 --> 01:46:51,379
Mary, it's me.

1170
01:46:51,453 --> 01:46:54,965
I decided to take off early.
I'll be at my lake house all weekend.

1171
01:46:55,036 --> 01:46:57,655
I don't want any calls
forwarded either. Do you understand?

1172
01:46:57,725 --> 01:47:00,375
Whoever it is,
they can all wait. Okay?

1173
01:47:00,444 --> 01:47:04,154
Listen, it's 4th ofJuly,
for Christ's sake. Thank you.

1174
01:47:19,228 --> 01:47:21,138
What the fuck?

1175
01:47:30,812 --> 01:47:32,787
Good. You brought the wine.

1176
01:48:51,708 --> 01:48:56,181
One time I bet a friend I could hold
a lit firecracker in my hand...

1177
01:48:56,252 --> 01:48:57,943
longer than he could.

1178
01:48:58,012 --> 01:48:59,092
Can I guess?

1179
01:48:59,164 --> 01:49:02,906
You lost the bet, and he lost
a finger. Am I right?

1180
01:49:03,997 --> 01:49:06,331
This won't hurt a bit.

1181
01:49:12,284 --> 01:49:14,585
Are we expecting guests?

1182
01:49:45,404 --> 01:49:49,659
We've traced your call and units
will be there in about ten minutes.

1183
01:49:49,724 --> 01:49:52,855
If you can do it safely,
just get out of the house.

1184
01:49:52,924 --> 01:49:56,055
Otherwise,
stay on the phone with me.

1185
01:49:56,124 --> 01:49:57,499
Ma'am?

1186
01:49:57,564 --> 01:50:00,313
Are you there? Ma'am?

1187
01:50:15,868 --> 01:50:17,941
You need to make sure
they feel welcome.

1188
01:50:23,004 --> 01:50:26,517
Are those shallots?
And caper berries.

1189
01:50:29,404 --> 01:50:31,313
That butter smells wonderful.

1190
01:50:32,572 --> 01:50:34,677
You feeling hungry, Paul?

1191
01:50:34,748 --> 01:50:36,603
Very.

1192
01:50:41,628 --> 01:50:43,930
What's the main course?

1193
01:50:43,996 --> 01:50:47,411
You should never ask.
It spoils the surprise.

1194
01:50:47,484 --> 01:50:52,121
Clarice, what are you doing up?
You should be resting. Get back to bed.

1195
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:54,163
I'm hungry.

1196
01:50:56,604 --> 01:50:59,288
Hello, Paul.
Paul, don't be rude.

1197
01:51:00,444 --> 01:51:03,314
Say, "Hello, Agent Starling."

1198
01:51:03,388 --> 01:51:06,684
Hello, Agent Starling.

1199
01:51:08,444 --> 01:51:10,353
I always wanted
to watch you eat.

1200
01:51:10,428 --> 01:51:15,316
What have you got in your hand?
Something to bash me on the head with?

1201
01:51:16,124 --> 01:51:18,513
Put it on the table.

1202
01:51:18,588 --> 01:51:19,897
Good girl.

1203
01:51:19,964 --> 01:51:22,135
Hey. That's mine.

1204
01:51:22,204 --> 01:51:23,862
Now sit down.

1205
01:51:26,044 --> 01:51:28,859
Hey, Clarice, love the dress.

1206
01:51:28,924 --> 01:51:30,931
It's beautiful.

1207
01:51:31,004 --> 01:51:33,143
What do you think, Paul?
Nice.

1208
01:51:34,204 --> 01:51:35,960
Nice.

1209
01:51:43,804 --> 01:51:47,100
Why don't you say grace, Paul?

1210
01:51:47,164 --> 01:51:49,498
Me?
Yeah.

1211
01:51:49,564 --> 01:51:51,157
Grace?
Sure.

1212
01:51:52,028 --> 01:51:53,938
Okay.

1213
01:51:54,012 --> 01:51:55,539
Bow your head.

1214
01:51:57,884 --> 01:52:00,699
Father, we thank Thee
for Thy blessings...

1215
01:52:00,764 --> 01:52:02,619
and dedicate them
to Thy mercy...

1216
01:52:02,684 --> 01:52:05,717
We are about to receive...

1217
01:52:05,788 --> 01:52:07,414
Forgive us all...

1218
01:52:07,484 --> 01:52:09,491
even white trash
like Starling here...

1219
01:52:09,564 --> 01:52:12,499
and bring her
into my service, amen.

1220
01:52:14,492 --> 01:52:18,616
I have to tell you, Paul, even the
Apostle Paul couldn't have done better.

1221
01:52:18,684 --> 01:52:20,691
He hated women too.

1222
01:52:20,764 --> 01:52:24,080
May I have some wine, please?
I don't think that's a good idea.

1223
01:52:24,156 --> 01:52:25,782
Not with the morphine.

1224
01:52:25,852 --> 01:52:28,218
I think you should
eat some broth. Okay?

1225
01:52:28,284 --> 01:52:33,073
By the way, that was a job offering
I worked into the blessing.

1226
01:52:33,148 --> 01:52:35,090
I'm going to Congress,
you know.

1227
01:52:35,164 --> 01:52:36,822
Are you?

1228
01:52:36,892 --> 01:52:39,575
Come around campaign headquarters.

1229
01:52:39,644 --> 01:52:42,992
You could be an office girl.
Can you type and file?

1230
01:52:43,068 --> 01:52:46,646
Can you take dictation?
Take this down.

1231
01:52:46,716 --> 01:52:50,491
Washington is full
of corn pone, country pussy.

1232
01:52:53,244 --> 01:52:55,894
I took it down.
You said it already.

1233
01:52:55,963 --> 01:52:59,127
Paul, now you're being rude,
and I hate rude people.

1234
01:52:59,196 --> 01:53:02,328
Drink your broth
like a good boy. Come on. Sip.

1235
01:53:03,932 --> 01:53:05,394
Good.

1236
01:53:08,508 --> 01:53:10,995
It's not very good, buddy.

1237
01:53:11,068 --> 01:53:13,938
I admit I added something to yours.
Perhaps it's clashing with the cumin.

1238
01:53:14,012 --> 01:53:17,208
But I assure you,
the next course is to die for.

1239
01:53:28,796 --> 01:53:30,684
Come on, Clarice.

1240
01:53:30,748 --> 01:53:32,755
That's a good girl.

1241
01:53:32,828 --> 01:53:34,355
Good.

1242
01:54:04,348 --> 01:54:05,395
Dr. Lecter.

1243
01:54:05,468 --> 01:54:09,396
You see, the brain itself feels no pain,
Clarice, if that concerns you.

1244
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:13,080
For example, Paul won't miss
this little piece here...

1245
01:54:13,148 --> 01:54:15,003
part of the prefrontal lobe...

1246
01:54:15,068 --> 01:54:18,035
which they say is
the seat of good manners.

1247
01:54:18,108 --> 01:54:21,686
Your profile at the border stations
has five features.

1248
01:54:21,756 --> 01:54:23,579
I'll trade you.
Trade?

1249
01:54:23,644 --> 01:54:28,051
Stop, and I'll tell you what they are.
How does that word taste to you?

1250
01:54:28,123 --> 01:54:32,018
Cheap and metallic,
like sucking on a greasy coin?

1251
01:54:32,092 --> 01:54:33,979
Who's Clarice?
Agent Starling, Paul.

1252
01:54:34,044 --> 01:54:37,360
If you can't keep up with the
conversation, try not to join in at all.

1253
01:54:37,436 --> 01:54:39,443
Paul, I'm Starling.

1254
01:54:39,516 --> 01:54:41,371
See...

1255
01:54:41,436 --> 01:54:43,291
here...

1256
01:54:43,356 --> 01:54:47,065
right here's the sac
that contains the brain.

1257
01:54:49,308 --> 01:54:51,763
I would really like some wine.

1258
01:54:55,068 --> 01:54:57,402
That smells great.
Yes.

1259
01:54:57,468 --> 01:55:00,502
There.
Like to try a little piece?

1260
01:55:00,572 --> 01:55:03,222
I would really like
some wine...

1261
01:55:04,956 --> 01:55:06,844
It is good.

1262
01:55:07,676 --> 01:55:11,222
All right. Just a little.

1263
01:55:12,636 --> 01:55:13,564
Okay?

1264
01:55:30,268 --> 01:55:33,083
Given the chance, you would deny me
my life, wouldn't you?

1265
01:55:34,267 --> 01:55:35,926
Not your life.

1266
01:55:35,996 --> 01:55:38,963
My freedom, just that.
You'd take that from me.

1267
01:55:39,036 --> 01:55:42,297
And if you did, would they have
you back, do you think?

1268
01:55:42,364 --> 01:55:44,819
The FBI?

1269
01:55:44,892 --> 01:55:48,208
Those people you despise almost
as much as they despise you?

1270
01:55:48,284 --> 01:55:51,317
Will they give you a medal,
Clarice, do you think?

1271
01:55:51,388 --> 01:55:54,617
Would you have it professionally framed
and hang it on your wall to look at...

1272
01:55:54,683 --> 01:55:58,906
and remind you of your courage
and incorruptibility?

1273
01:56:01,403 --> 01:56:04,720
All you would need for that,
Clarice, is a mirror.

1274
01:56:06,236 --> 01:56:10,546
I have plans for that smart mouth.
I'm never gonna hire you now.

1275
01:56:15,451 --> 01:56:17,175
Remember what I said?

1276
01:56:17,244 --> 01:56:19,961
If you can't be polite
to our guests...

1277
01:56:20,028 --> 01:56:22,745
you have to sit
at the kiddies' table.

1278
01:56:23,644 --> 01:56:25,815
Don't get up, Clarice.

1279
01:56:25,884 --> 01:56:29,462
Paul will help me clear
and make the coffee.

1280
01:56:31,388 --> 01:56:33,297
Just think about
what I said, Clarice.

1281
01:56:35,451 --> 01:56:36,978
Coffee.

1282
01:57:13,532 --> 01:57:15,899
I came halfway
around the world...

1283
01:57:15,964 --> 01:57:18,266
to watch you run, Clarice.

1284
01:57:20,636 --> 01:57:22,545
Let me run, huh?

1285
01:57:40,924 --> 01:57:45,179
Tell me, Clarice,
would you ever say to me...

1286
01:57:45,244 --> 01:57:46,738
"Stop.

1287
01:57:46,812 --> 01:57:48,721
If you loved me, you'd stop"?

1288
01:57:50,395 --> 01:57:52,567
Not in a thousand years.

1289
01:57:54,044 --> 01:57:55,953
Not in a thousand years.

1290
01:58:01,403 --> 01:58:03,313
That's my girl.

1291
01:58:16,444 --> 01:58:19,957
Now, that's really
interesting, Clarice...

1292
01:58:20,028 --> 01:58:21,970
and I'm really pressed for time.

1293
01:58:22,044 --> 01:58:24,761
So where's the key?

1294
01:58:25,692 --> 01:58:27,601
Where's the key?

1295
01:58:33,116 --> 01:58:34,577
Okay.

1296
01:58:39,324 --> 01:58:40,698
Above...

1297
01:58:40,763 --> 01:58:42,487
or below the wrist...

1298
01:58:42,556 --> 01:58:44,116
Clarice?

1299
01:58:51,388 --> 01:58:54,202
This is really gonna hurt.

1300
01:59:40,924 --> 01:59:43,444
Show me your hands!

1301
01:59:43,515 --> 01:59:45,970
Identify yourself!

1302
01:59:46,043 --> 01:59:47,799
I'm Clarice Starling!

1303
01:59:48,827 --> 01:59:50,737
FBI!

1304
02:00:47,387 --> 02:00:49,045
Hi.
Hi.

1305
02:00:49,115 --> 02:00:50,741
What's that?

1306
02:00:52,603 --> 02:00:54,611
That's caviar.

1307
02:00:54,684 --> 02:00:57,815
What are those?
These are figs.

1308
02:00:57,883 --> 02:00:59,858
And that?

1309
02:01:01,947 --> 02:01:03,508
This?

1310
02:01:04,827 --> 02:01:07,097
That I don't think
you would like.

1311
02:01:07,164 --> 02:01:09,368
It looks good.
Oh, it is good.

1312
02:01:09,436 --> 02:01:10,810
Can I have some?

1313
02:01:12,155 --> 02:01:14,774
You're a very unusual boy,
aren't you?

1314
02:01:14,844 --> 02:01:18,160
I couldn't eat what they gave me.
Nor should you. It isn't even food...

1315
02:01:18,236 --> 02:01:21,781
as I understand the definition,
which is why I always bring my own.

1316
02:01:24,156 --> 02:01:26,425
So, which would you like to try?

1317
02:01:30,747 --> 02:01:33,082
Well, I suppose it's all right.

1318
02:01:34,683 --> 02:01:39,385
After all, as your mother tells you,
and my mother certainly told me...

1319
02:01:39,452 --> 02:01:41,841
"It is important,"
she always used to say...

1320
02:01:41,915 --> 02:01:44,698
"always to try new things."

1321
02:01:44,764 --> 02:01:46,105
Open up.
